Hello, my name is Loritta (or, as my close friends call me, "Lori") and I am just a simple Brazilian Discord bot with many functions never seen before in other bots!

I have a few entertainment-focused functions (for example the meme command), social functions (XP profile system and reputation), I am extremely customizable; (you can enable / disable any of my commands at will, change my command prefix to whatever you want and more! ) and I was created with a simple focus: Be the best Brazilian Discord bot!   

One of the reasons I came to be what I am today is the lack of Brazilian Discord bots, even moreso since many Brazilian Discord servers use "low quality" bots that just happen to be in Portuguese or use bots only allow communication with the user in English ... and let's face it, none of these options seem pleasant to use ... and that's why I promise to change this!   

## ü§î How do I add Loritta to my server?   

If you want to add Loritta to your server, you can do so by clicking [here](http://loritta.website/dashboard)!

While it's possible to host her yourself, we won't provide support to anyone who wants to do/does this to avoid people creating clones and taking all the credit for creating Loritta. However you are more than welcome to host her yourself if it's to help and contribute to the project.   
## üíÅ How to get support

You can get support for Loritta [here](https://loritta.website/support)!

## üôã How can I contribute?

Since Loritta is made up from many different parts [which can all be found here](https://github.com/LorittaBot), contributions to the other parts, aside from this one, are also very much appreciated.
* [Loritta](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta): Holds the source code behind Loritta (the "backend"), included in this is the bot itself (commands and features) and the backend of the website that's used to interface with her.
* [LorittaLocales](https://github.com/LorittaBot/LorittaLocales): Holds the translations/translatable strings for Loritta.
* [LorittaWebsite](https://github.com/LorittaBot/LorittaWebsite): Holds the "Frontend" of the Loritta webinterface/website including images, CSS, HTML, and other necessary assets.
* [PerfectDreams](https://github.com/PerfectDreams): A Loritta themed Minecraft-Server!

### üíµ How do I donate?

Even if you can't contribute to the project here, monetary contributions in form of donations are very much appreciated! Donations are vital to keep Lorittas development going and they are needed for her stay online! Even the smallest donation helps, and if you have a few bucks to spare please help and donate at: https://loritta.website/donate

### üôå How do I use this?
#### üë®‚Äçüíª How do I compile Loritta?

You can also host Loritta yourself if you don't want to use the official version, but please keep in mind ...
* The reason this project is open-source is to inspire others to learn and get to know how the inner workings of the project. The goal is that fans of the project are able to see how it works and thus are more easily able to help/contrinute to the project.
* You will absolutely not get any support whatsoever if you host Loritta or use her components to become *famous* or *respected* or *well known*, or in your own personal interest or gain, in any way shape or form. Keep in mind that the Project is licensed under the [AGPL v3 License](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta/blob/master/LICENSE), which **requires you to open-source your changes to the project**! If you break or not follow this license we **will take action against you**.
* Again, you won't get support with anything related to your self hosted version, **self-hosting is absolutely and exclusively at your own risk**.
* You will get help and support with hosting her if it's to contribute to the project, and only so at my own discretion.
* Remember that running Loritta takes API-Keys for multiple different services as for her functionality. Not providing them might cause her to malfunction or might cause parts to not function correctly.
* Assets such as images aren't included in the project as they may be licensed differently. Some parts of the project might not work or not work correctly as a result. Please keep that in mind.
* Please do also keep in mind that Loritta was never meant to be hosted by third parties, so running her might require you to adjust a few of the many "hard-coded" settings in the source code and have you compile the project yourself. üòâ
* Loritta is hosted on Ubuntu 18.04, it's possible she won't work correctly on other systems
* You may not name any self hosted instance of her like the original "Loritta".

But if you still really want to host Loritta, follow these steps:
1. Have MongoDB installed on your system.
2. Have JDK8 or newer installed on your system.
3. Have a git-shell or the git-cli tools installed on your system.
4. Have Maven installed on your system. Be sure that the `PATH` and `JAVA_HOME` variables are set up correctly and point to the correct locations.
4. Have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your system
5. Run ```git clone https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta.git``` to clone and download the Loritta source code.
6. Now enter the downloaded folder either with your git-enabled shell or PowerShell/GitBash on Windows and run `mvn install`
7. After maven finished compiling, enter the `target` folder and copy the file ` Loritta-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and the folder "libs".
8. Start the JAR that you copied using or your shell using `java -jar Loritta-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. You will probably have to allocate more memory to Loritta to avoid OutOfMemoryExceptions. You can do that by adding the additional start parameters `-Xmx8G -Xms8G` for example allocates 8GBs of memory to the bot.
9. After starting her, a file named `config.json` will be created. Open it with a text editor (like Notepad ++) complete her configuration by filling in all missing values. The configuration file will have some values pre-completed with explanations about what it is for and where it came from to make your life a bit easier.
10. After you finish configuring her, and everything is set up correctly, you should be able to start her with the aforementioned command! üéâ
#### üîÄ Pull Requests

You should follow my cute code style in your pull requests, it is also recommended that you properly comment your code to make it easier to read.

If your code contains text that's read by a user, you are required to use Loritta's localization system so your Pull Request can be translated into other languages, ie after creating your Pull Request, create a Pull Request in the [LorittaLocales Repository](https://github.com/LorittaBot/LorittaLocales) with the added keys.

Please don't propose pull requests that contains *joke or goofy code*. I might so occasionally do so myself but that doesn't mean you can do that.

Please ask yourself "Is this useful for anyone else?" before you propose a pull request. If it's only useful for you or your server, you should use the [Loritta JavaScript API](https://loritta.website/loriapi) instead to add that feature to your server. Pull requests like these are very likely to be denied without further consideration.

Features (such as commands) related to NSFW stuff **won't be** added to Loritta. Your Pull Request will be denied without any consideration. I'd rather have people at her as a bot that creates rude memes than a bot that keeps sending NSFW content.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Loritta requires [several external dependencies](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta/blob/master/pom.xml) to function. A big thanks goes to the maintainers of those dependencies! Without you, Loritta would probably not exist (or would be severely dunced feature-wise!)
