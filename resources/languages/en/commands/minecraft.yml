  result: "The sweatshirt magic thingy is done and now you are going to be 200% more comfortable... heck, losing a hardcore world to a baby zombie has never felt so cozy! Download your new skin, upload it on your Minecraft account and spread the joy of my super cute and warm sweatshirt!"
  invalidMinecraftSkin: "Sorry, but that doesn't look like a valid Minecraft skin! I can only do my sweatshirt magic with the skin file itself, not with a fancy render of the skin! Keep in mind that Minecraft's skins dimensions are 32x64 or 64x64!"
