    "daily.questions.commandBugs.incorrectExplanation": "The urban legend that there are scripts, bugs, and similar things to give you more chances of winning bets is nothing more than a huge, gigantic fake news. Just think: \"Why would the owner of Loritta create a secret command for you to have a better chance of winning bets?\" You'll never have a positive answer. And if such bugs really existed, you should report them to the team!",

    "daily.questions.willIGetBannedIfICreateANewAccount.incorrectExplanation": "Your happiness wouldn't last long! Imagine earning millions of sonhos on your alt and then getting banned again for evasion (using another account).

This is because it's a virtual product, and we can't simply verify if you've used the product before you ask for your money back. Also, requesting a refund for a product you've received and used is fraud.",
    "daily.questions.sonhosThreat.title": "Should you pay if a user threatens you and asks for sonhos to avoid being reported?",
    "daily.questions.sonhosThreat.yes": "I won't pay",

    "daily.questions.sonhosThreat.incorrectExplanation": "Who has nothing to fear! Why would you pay someone not to report you if you're innocent? Don't fall for scams like that if you know you've done nothing wrong. In fact, if anyone does this to you, report the user to the Loritta team!",
    "daily.questions.foundBugs.title": "If you find a bug in Loritta, should you notify the Staff and not abuse the bug?",

    "daily.questions.cautionWhenReceivingTooManySonhos.yes": "Yes",

    "daily.questions.cautionWhenReceivingTooManySonhos.incorrectExplanation": "You should always be cautious when accepting random amounts from people, as there's a high chance that person is a scoundrel about to be banned, and receiving an amount from them could get you banned too.",
