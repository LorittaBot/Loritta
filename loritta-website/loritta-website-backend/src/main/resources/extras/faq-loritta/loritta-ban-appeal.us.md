title: "Loritta Ban Appeal"
authors: [ "mrpowergamerbr" ]
---
**These are only appeals to be unbanned from using Loritta, they are not appeals to be unbanned from her support server!**

If you were banned from using Loritta, you can have the privilege to have a second chance by making an appeal to forgive the reason of your ban. But know that you can lose your second chance if you keep bothering the team, insisting on your unban or breaking the rules of Loritta's servers.

In this page, when we are saying that it is to "wait X months", it means that it is to wait X months since the date that you were banned from using Loritta BEFORE MAKING AN APPEAL. The date of when you were banned appears when someone tries to view your profile with Loritta's `+profile` command.

## Rules for Appeals
* You only possess one chance to make an appeal, in case your appeal is rejected, you will not have another chance!
* Using Loritta is not a right, but a privilege! We are not obliged to unban you just because you got regretful of what you did.
* Insisting for Loritta's team to verify your appeal will make it be rejected.
* You are obliged to verify if enough time has passed from the day that you were banned from using Loritta in our list of ban reasons below. In case you create an appeal before enough time has passed, your appeal will be rejected and you will not have another chance to make a new appeal to be unbanned!
* The team reserves the right to accept or reject appeals in the way that it prefers. The team is not obliged to justify the reason for us having accepted or rejected an appeal.
* Asking for unban outside the form, like in support channels or in other servers, is prohibited and will make your appeal be rejected.
* If "friends" of yours start to disturb the team asking for you to be unbanned, we will understand that you yourself asked for them to do this, and this will make your appeal be rejected.
* If you were a jerk with members and/or with Loritta's team, your appeal will be rejected.

## Bans considered unjust
* If you think that your ban was unjust, you can make the appeal independently of the time that you are banned, but stay aware that the rule of being able to make the form only once is still valid. You will also lose the chance to be unbanned in case your ban has been really just.
* Upon making the form, send all the justifications and proofs that your ban was not just. It is permitted that you attach the proofs in the "Draw a Kitten" part of the form.

## Reasons that are PERMANENT and that will have their appeals rejected

Some types of ban in Loritta do not allow appeal, because they are ban reasons that the person had to act in a malicious way to break the rules, which is not something that they manage to do without knowing.

In the past, some reasons of this list allowed appeal, but we had to remove the possibility of appeal. This is because the majority of people that had their appeals accepted went back to break the rules, abusing of our good will to unban them. Besides that, many users lied to the team, alleging not having evaded the ban when, in truth, they possessed several alternative accounts to bypass the punishment. This hindered the team's work.

Remembering that even if it is permanent without having chance of appeal, the team has total right to unban any person that broke Loritta's rules, even if the reason of it is a reason without chance of appeal.

### Dreams Commerce (Purchase and Sale)
* "Dreams Commerce" means buying things with real monetary value for dreams, like buying Discord Nitro, and other things, for dreams.

### Ban Evasion
* In case you have tried to evade bans in other accounts, your ban is permanent and you cannot make an appeal to be unbanned.
* Using another Discord account while you are banned from Loritta in your main one is not "ban evasion", since you do not use Loritta's functionalities while you use the other account. But in the moment that you use any functionalities of Loritta, you can be banned for ban evasion. That is, you do not need to worry about taking ban for evasion upon entering Loritta's server to make an appeal. However, the team can have other criteria that can make you be banned in your other account even if you have not used Loritta's functionalities in it, for example, if you keep provoking the team to unban you, depending on your original ban reason, among other reasons.

### Using multiple accounts to farm dreams in daily
* Using multiple accounts to farm dreams in daily to bypass the restriction of one daily prize per person will make you be banned permanently.

### Bugs/Exploits Abuse
* Abusing bugs or exploits in Loritta or in other services related to Loritta will make you be banned permanently.
* **Exception:** If you abused but helped the team to discover the problem, we can transform your ban into a temporary ban.

### Lying to Loritta's team
* If you lied to Loritta's team means that you did not learn your lesson and that you must continue banned.

### Raiding in servers related to Loritta
* Against Discord's terms of use, the appeal will be rejected.

### NSFW Content in Loritta's commands or as avatar/banner on Discord
* Against Discord's terms of use, the appeal will be rejected.

### Spreading personal information of a person
* Against Discord's terms of use, the appeal will be rejected.

### Dreams Theft
* **Exception:** The person that was robbed warned to the team that you can be unbanned, in this case you need to wait 12 months before making an appeal. Your dreams will be removed.

### Impersonating Loritta's team
* If you are really from Loritta's team you manage to unban yourself alone, lol.

### Asking to delete account data
* It was you that asked to delete and Loritta warned you that you would be banned!

### Spamming commands during the cooldown
* Normal people do not try to keep spamming commands when Loritta keeps saying that the wait time starts to increase. The protection exists to not flood messages with the objective of her falling.

### Chargeback/Requesting money devolution
* You accepted the payment terms at the time of purchase, where there exists a clause that indicates that asking for money devolution is prohibited and you will be banned from using Loritta, since this harms Loritta.
* **Exception:** In case you manage to prove that you did not receive the product, you can make an appeal.

### Commerce for dreams of paid subscriptions obtained illegally 
* This is a crime, the appeal will be rejected.

## Special Reasons

### Bans considered unjust
* If you think that your ban was unjust, you can make the appeal independently of the time that you are banned, but stay aware that the rule of being able to make the form only once is still valid. You will also lose the chance to be unbanned in case your ban has been really just.
* Upon making the form, send all the justifications and proofs that your ban was not just. It is permitted that you attach the proofs in the "Draw a Kitten" part of the form.

### Multiple reasons in your ban
* If you possess multiple reasons in your ban, you must use as base time the infraction that has the highest wait time, and then sum with the rest of the infractions divided by two, and thus you will have the time that you need to wait.
* **Example:** If you were banned for "Creating multiple accounts to farm dreams in daily" and "Dreams Commerce (Sale)", you must sum 18 + (9 / 2), which gives 22.5. Thus you will have to wait 22.5 months before sending an appeal.

## Minimum time of bans necessary before asking for an appeal

### Dreams Commerce (Rewards Server/Team Only)
* Only for people who did not interact in the chat/reactions/etc before the sale message made by a superior in the team, in case having interacted after, the rules of "Dreams Commerce (Sale)" are the ones that are valid
* You need to wait 3 months before making an appeal

### Banned by association
* You need to wait 9 months before making an appeal
* **Exception:** If the person that made you be banned originally is unbanned, you can make an appeal without waiting.

### Impersonating Loritta
* You need to wait 1 month before making an appeal
* **Exception:** You tried to impersonate Loritta in servers related to her.
* * If you only sent "hi" and was banned before the team or other members asked to change, the ban increases from one month to three months.
* * If you continued to impersonate Loritta even after the warnings of the team and of members, the ban is permanent and the appeal will be rejected.
* **Exception:** You created a bot to impersonate Loritta, the ban is permanent and the appeal will be rejected.
* **Exception:** If you are purposefully impersonating Loritta to trick other people

### Offending/Cursing Loritta
* You need to wait 2 months before making an appeal
* **Exception:** In case the cursing was in servers related to Loritta, the ban increases from 2 months to 6 months. After all, would you like that someone entered in your house just to curse your work?
* **Exception:** In case the cursing was something racist, homophobic or inappropriate things, the ban is permanent and the appeal will be rejected.

### Asking to be banned
