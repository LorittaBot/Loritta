Many people believe that it is possible to "bug" the `coinflip`/`coinflip bet`, making you always win any match of coinflip with another person.

## A person that always wins from me in coinflip said that she uses a cheat to win!
Do not believe in these lies, she is only inventing stories for you to think that she knows something secret that you cannot know.

### We have heard everything
* Keep giving `coinflip` until the side you so desire falls in `coinflip bet` increases your chances of winning.
* The same thing that is above, but doing the `coinflip` in another server.
* Taking long to accept the bet in `coinflip bet` makes your chances increase.
* Loritta has a cheat and always makes her win in `coinflip bet`.
* Download modified applications just to have a higher chance of winning. (And this is the most dangerous! Since applications can give you viruses and steal your account! And of course, it is impossible for a modified application to give you more chance of winning)

Among other wild stories that make no sense

## The only ways to bug the coinflip
* Discovering the random "seed" (source) that Loritta is utilizing. Knowing the source, it is possible to predict with 100% of efficacy which would be the subsequent results. But even so you would have the entropy problem, since as several functionalities of Loritta utilize the same random source, each utilization of this source alters the subsequent result, thus it would be practically unfeasible to guess with precision which would be the next result of your coinflip.
* Managing to alter the random source that Loritta is using. If you manage to alter, you would manage to have total control over the source and thus use the values that you wanted. But, if you managed to alter the random source without anyone from the Loritta team knowing (that is, "hack" Loritta's source code), wouldn't it be easier for you to just give dreams to yourself?
* Altering how the `coinflip`/`coinflip bet` works to make you always have 100% chance of winning. But again, if you managed to alter the random source without anyone from the Loritta team knowing (that is, "hack" Loritta's source code), wouldn't it be easier for you to just give dreams to yourself?

All these possibilities are so unlikely and difficult to happen, that we reach the conclusion that no one managed to "bug" the coinflip.

## Okay, but there is still a person that always wins from me in coinflip!
This is called "probability" and "luck". In real life there also exists the chance that someone spins a coin and it always falls heads in real life. This is something rare to happen, but it is possible to happen, right?

Probability and Statistics is a subject that you should learn during High School, if you still haven't learned or already forgot the concepts, watch the video below to remember!

## Is there any way for me to know the probability of wins/losses of someone in coinflip bet?
Yes! You can see your statistics and other users' with `coinflip bet stats`.

According to probability and statistics: The more times you play, the percentage of wins/losses will get closer to 50%.

In other words, if you see some user that already played more than a thousand times and even then he possesses a percentage of wins above 60%... then it means that *really* this person might know of some cheat to win... or it is just luck!
