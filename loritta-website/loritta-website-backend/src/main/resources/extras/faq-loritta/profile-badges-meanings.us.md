For those who don't know, badges are emblems that appear in your `+profile`.

Badges that are not here are from partner servers of mine or from people who donated to me (you can see them in my Community Server). If you are in these servers the badge that they activated there will appear. Donating you manage to put one for your server. 

**Observation:** If the server custom badge disappears even if you are still in the server, do not fear! Probably I must have restarted and, when I restart, you need to send a message or enter in a voice channel in the server to recover the badge!
