Did you know there are people who make wonderful arts of me just because I helped in their server? I even melt inside with so much cute art of me! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593980911335505940.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

So to show the incredible arts that they made, I resolved to create [a page](https://loritta.website/br/fanarts) that shows the fan arts that they made! Thanks to everyone who made these fan arts <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/562303822978875403.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">, I become happy that there exists so many people like this that like what I do!

## How to send a fan art?

So upon sending your fan art, you win as a gift a role! Yay!
1. Read and follow all the rules of the <span class="discord-mention">#📕│artist rules</span> and of the <span class="discord-mention">#📝│rules</span> (Channels of the [Community Server](/support), join them if you want to send a fanart!); If you break any rule, your fan art will be rejected!
2. After finishing your fan art, open a ticket in <span class="discord-mention">#💓│first-fan-art</span>.
3. Upon creating a ticket, send your drawing (together with the development stages of it) and, if you want, send a description about it and wait for your fan art to be approved by some member of the team! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/521721811298156558.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

### But attention!
Depending on how you make your fanart, it is good to follow some tips, to deliver a fanart worthy of rewards!

* The drawing must be in png! Never use jpg for digital drawings, jpg was made for photos and loses quality in digital drawings!
* If your drawing doesn't have a customized "background" (that is, has white/transparent background), cut the image so that only the drawing stays!
Examples of Digital Arts:

* Utilize jpg to save space!
* The photo of the drawing must be decent, that is: With good lighting, focused correctly and rotated in the correct position; The clearer and easier to be visualized, better!

### Resuming...
* Send the image on Discord (instead of sending the image on other websites and then sending the link in the channel)
* We want proofs (screenshots of the screen, sketch of the drawing, photo of the PC screen, etc.) that it was you who made the drawing, send photos of the art process together with the drawing! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886583205898.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
Examples of Proofs:

* We do not accept drawings made over a base or plagiarized, this type of content will not be tolerated when not credited inside the server and cannot be used as a way to win role!
* The art needs to be neat, make the fan art with much love, affection and dedication! We know that there exist artists of different styles and potential here, however it is not cool to make any scribble just to win the role.
* After sending the fan art, wait for the team to see, analyze and approve (or not! The team can reject your drawing and it will not need to clarify the reason of it having been rejected) your drawing. Do not stay bothering the server team insisting so that they approve soon! Remember that this takes a time and the only bot here is Loritta, for the rest we are humans who many times are busy and have other responsibilities in our day-to-day! If you stay insisting, you will be punished for "begging for the artist role". <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/741058240455901254.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
* Make your art with affection! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/412482280548728833.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> Remember that it will be posted on the site! Always give your best when making any drawing (and not only Loritta's)! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/357976795783626752.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## Reference Sheet
And not only forget the main element! The **Loritta's reference sheet**, since she is a character, she must come accompanied by her classic outfit lol.

While Lori loves using her white hoodie, she also has a black version of the hoodie.

The lines of her hoodie (the ones that stay on the arm) possess a lighter line and a darker one, while the details of the hoodie (collar, etc) are an intermediate blue tone between the two colors.

There exist these two different colors to demonstrate the balance between what Lori does: The light blue represents joy and peace, the dark blue represents moderation and justice.

Currently we have two main **Ref Sheets** about Loritta, one of colors and another of her outfits, you can use them to obtain the correct coloration of Loritta's colors. **Do not use the Ref Sheet with principles for Tracing or anything of the type, we are not going to allow actions of the type, and you can be banned from Loritta if you try to plagiarize or trace some artist of hers.**
