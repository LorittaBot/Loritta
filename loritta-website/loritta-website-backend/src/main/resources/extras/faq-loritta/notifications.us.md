The YouTube module serves to notify videos of a determined channel, the Twitch one notifies the live streams, and the Twitter one notifies tweets. You can put up to 5 channels/profiles for me to notify you if you are not a donor.

1. To configure a channel or profile, access the control panel of your server, by [clicking here](/dashboard) or using the command `+panel` in your server.

2. Upon accessing the panel, you will be in the General Configuration module, so select the YouTube, Twitch or Twitter module, according to what you are searching for.

4. Then copy and paste the link of the channel or profile in the panel configuration. Select the text channel to send the notifications and customize your message with emojis and mentions. Use the *placeholder* `{link}` in your message: where you put it in the message will be where Loritta will send the notification link. There you will also find a list with other *placeholders*.

**Observation:** YouTube live streams are notified only in the end of them, thanks to YouTube's system... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/585951728365600779.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
