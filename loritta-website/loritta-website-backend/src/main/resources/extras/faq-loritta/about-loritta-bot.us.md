## How do I change Loritta's avatar?
It is impossible to change her avatar, only who created her can change, and, when changing, the avatar is changed for everyone who uses Loritta... We will not change her avatar just because you want to put a silly little image with your server logo.  
#### Loritta's avatar is only changed:
* On some commemorative dates;
* During the occurrence of some event in the same;
* Every Sunday Loritta keeps changing the avatar to show the incredible fan arts they made for her;

## What are the variables/placeholders that I can use in panel messages?
There are several placeholders that you can use in Loritta's messages! See the list by [clicking here](/extras/faq-loritta/placeholders)!

## Why does Loritta exist?
**She exists for several reasons, but here goes some of them...**
* I wanted to remake my old bot (SparklyBot) that I had made just for fun (it was very messy, since it was my first bot), it was a bot with several entertainment commands (many of them were added to Loritta! Like treta news, anti-invite system, vaporwave and much more!) and with some basic functions like join/leave messages.
* <span class="discord-mention">@Pandinhaaa</span> wanted a bot for her Discord server.
* At the time I didn't know any decent Brazilian bot for Discord and, at the time, several Brazilian people were starting to migrate to Discord.
So I resolved to create <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta</span>!

## When was Loritta created?
She started being developed on March 30, 2017, but she only became public for anyone to add on April 12, 2017.

## Who made Loritta's avatar?
Loritta's original avatar, the one everyone knows, was made by `MrPowerGamerBR#4185`, Loritta's creator!  
On commemorative dates, special events and on Sundays, Loritta changes avatar, when this happens, just use the command `+avatar @Loritta#0219` to know which artist made her avatar!

## Can I make videos, tutorials, drawings, stories with the character and the bot Loritta?
Yes! You have total right to make videos, tutorials, drawings/fan arts, stories and much more with Loritta! If you want, you can show your work to our team in the [community server](/support).

## Loritta is talking alone in my server!
Before you go "jesus save me lori was hacked take her out of the server aaaaaa <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/540656812836519936.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">", there are several reasons for her to be talking like that.

If you see a "strange" message coming from her, it can be several things, like for example:
* Someone using the command `+say`, it is possible for you to send messages in a channel using `+say` even in other text channels (`+say `<span class="discord-mention">#text-channel</span>` I am very cute!`), to discover if anyone is doing this, just look at the end of the message, since all say messages are accompanied by watermarks (<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/727631176432484473.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> *Message sent by <span class="discord-mention">@someone</span>*).
* Someone using the "Test Message" function on her panel. To facilitate the creation and customization of messages, there exists a button on her panel to test your created message, for you to see how it looks on Discord. Unfortunately some people like to "abuse" this function using it to send messages as if it were Loritta.
* Someone created a bot or a webhook with the same avatar and name as Loritta. To discover if it is a fake bot or webhook, see if the icon "Bot" (<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/435160161959542784.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">) next to the name has a verified like this <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/709419909536284712.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/709419956298842156.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">, if it doesn't have, it means it is not Loritta!

## Which language does Loritta use, and which library?
Portuguese, English, Spanish... ah, calm down, that is not what you want to know, right?

Originally she was created in Java (I utilized Eclipse to program), but a few months after I had created her, I became interested about Kotlin, so I resolved to start to migrate her to Kotlin!

Currently she is made using [<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/453714186925637642.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (utilizing IntelliJ IDEA to program), using the incredible library [<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/411518264267767818.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) to interact with the Discord platform.
