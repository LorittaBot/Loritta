title: "Doubts and information about some LorittaLand bots"

To keep alive and in good functioning the servers of LorittaLand and even Loritta herself, we utilize diverse resources like other versions of Loritta, bots and many others.  
And thanks to this, some doubts regarding some of these resources may appear in your head. And if it is for this fact the reason of you being here, then it is your lucky day.  

## Explaining the "Lorittas"

If you already visited some server that makes part of LorittaLand, I bet that you perceived the presence of different versions of Loritta and even some bots that you had never seen before.  
And it is these bots that are used with the intuition of managing and facilitating exclusive resources of some LorittaLand servers, avoiding adding much junk :tm: in Lori's source code.  
Now enough of stalling and let's go straight to the explanation!  

### Which are they and what do they do?
* <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta Morenitta 😘</span> (`Loritta#0219 - 297153970613387264`) is the main one, the one that everyone knows. And it is the Loritta that can be added in your server;
* <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta • Canary 🐦</span> (`Loritta (Beta)#7959 - 395935916952256523`) is the experimental (beta) version of the main Loritta. That is, the news go first there, tested and then go for my main account! We do like this to avoid putting experimental functions in my main account;
* <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta • Helper 💁</span> (`Loritta Helper#8503 - 761931447207460864`) is the Loritta that helps people with automatic answers, reports and helps with special resources in the [Community](https://discord.gg/lori) and [Support](https://discord.gg/loritta) server;
* <span class="discord-mention">@Pantufa • SparklyPower 🎮</span> (`Pantufa#3783 - 390927821997998081`) is the bot from SparklyPower, the official Minecraft server of Loritta. And if you got curious and want to know SparklyPower, [click here](https://discord.gg/sparklypower)! 

Remembering that only <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta Morenitta 😘</span> (`Loritta#0219 - 297153970613387264`) can be added in the server. The other Lorittas are private and we do not make available links so that you add them.

## "Strange... But some servers have Loritta Canary added, why?"

Formerly <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta • Canary 🐦</span> (`Loritta (Beta)#7959 - 395935916952256523`) could be added in servers. Nowadays, Canary is not addable anymore for some reasons:
* She is an experimental version of Loritta, so there doesn't exist necessity of her use and also for this reason we do not give support for the same.
* And even if her invite was released, it is currently impossible to add her in any server, because due to changes in Discord, bots with more than 100 servers cannot enter in new ones anymore if they are not verified.
