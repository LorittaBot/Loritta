The member counter is a system where I put a counter in the topic of a text channel to show in a cool way how many members are in your server at that moment. 

Normal users manage to enable only 1 counter in their servers. Whereas <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593979718919913474.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> premium users <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593979718919913474.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">, activating a [premium key](/extras/faq-loritta/premium-keys), manage to enable up to 3 counters. [Click here](/donate) to become a premium user!

## How do I enable the member counter?
1. Access the control panel of your server by [clicking here](/dashboard) or using the command `+panel` in your server.

2. Upon accessing the panel, you will start by the General Configuration module. Search then for the Member Counter module in the list to your left.

3. When you are already in the module, search for the text channel that you want to enable the counter and then click on the button to enable. After that, you must fill where the counter will stay in the topic of your channel, putting the [placeholder](/extras/faq-loritta/placeholders) `{counter}` where the numbers should stay. Next, choose the theme of the numbers and the padding with zeros.
