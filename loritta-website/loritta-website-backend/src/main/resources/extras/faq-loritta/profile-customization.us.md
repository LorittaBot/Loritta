title: "Customizing your profile"
authors: [ "arth" ]
---

Your profile in Loritta can be seen using the command `+profile`. To see other people's profile, use the command `+profile <mention or person ID>`. It is your little corner inside the bot, with information about you, bio and customizable background and layout. Next you will see how to customize each one of these items.

## About Me
The about me is your biography. Just as it exists in other social networks, you can put a little of yourself. To alter it, use the command `+aboutme <text>`.

The message that you put in the about me will stay visible to all people that visit your profile. No putting ugly things <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/395010059157110785.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> because I can ban you from using my commands in case you do this!

## Badges
Badges or emblems are small icons that appear in your profile that symbolize achievements. Want to know more about emblems? [Click here](/extras/faq-loritta/profile-badges-meanings)! We have a section only about them.

## Background
The background, also called wallpaper, is simply the image that appears in the background of your profile. The backgrounds are available for you to buy in my daily shop, which you can access by [clicking here](/dashboard/daily-shop). It updates every day at 00:00 UTC (21:00 of Brasilia), bringing different backgrounds for you to buy! Upon buying a background, you will be able to equip it in the [Backgrounds](/dashboard/backgrounds) section of the panel. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> 

Beyond the daily shop, you can get <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/524933940465893376.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> legendary backgrounds <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/524933940465893376.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> participating in my events. In my last events of Christmas, Halloween and Anniversary I gave special backgrounds for who attained certain level in them, besides many dreams, of course!

The backgrounds are divided in rarities, and their rarities influence in the prices. See the following list:

> * **Common**: 2,500 dreams
> * **Uncommon**: 5,000 dreams
> * **Rare**: 10,000 dreams
> * **Epic**: 25,000 dreams
> * **Legendary**: 80,000 dreams

You can suggest new backgrounds and be notified when there are new backgrounds for the daily shop in my [community server](discord.gg/lori)! Enter in the server and search for the channels `backgrounds` and `novos-backgrounds`, respectively.

It updates every day at 00:00 UTC (21:00 of Brasilia), bringing different layouts for you to buy! Upon buying a layout, you can equip it in the [Profile Layout](/dashboard/profiles) section of the panel.
