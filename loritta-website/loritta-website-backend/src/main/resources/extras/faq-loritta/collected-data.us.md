Many people have curiosity to know what Loritta keeps about you, so here has a complete list about what she keeps and why she keeps such information.

* **Account Emails (Daily and Reputations):** Loritta will keep your account email upon getting daily and upon giving reputations to other users. Your email is saved to help the team detect fake/alt accounts created with the objective of "farming" dreams and/or reputations.
* **IPs (Daily and Reputations):** Loritta will keep your account IP upon getting daily and upon giving reputations to other users. Your IP is saved to help the team detect fake/alt accounts created with the objective of "farming" dreams and/or reputations.
* **IPs (Website Connections):** Your IP is temporarily kept (for at most one week) in our website connection records.
* **Messages (Event Log):** All your messages in a server with the functionality of "Show deleted messages" and "Show edited messages" are kept. It is necessary to keep them so that the team can see the message before it had been deleted or edited, since Discord does not provide this information when a message is edited or deleted.
* **Messages (Commands):** Upon executing a Loritta command, Loritta will keep the message of the command that you executed. We save this since it is useful to find bugs in commands, see which users use most and which are the most utilized commands.
* **Messages (General):** Upon sending a message, Loritta will keep the hash of your last message and when it was sent. We save this to calculate how much experience you must receive with each message that you send.
* **User Cache:** Loritta keeps your account ID (the numbers that each account has), Name, Discriminator and the Avatar Link. We save this because keeping requesting to Discord information about a person possesses low limits and, if we didn't keep this information, any rank command and similars could not exist!
* **Data created by you:** For Loritta to be able to show your beautiful `aboutme`, the humble messages that you put in `rep`, the configurations of your server and other functionalities of the genre, she needs to keep what you wrote upon executing the command. (Which is kind of obvious, how would she show something that you put without keeping it in some place?) 

**All this information is in accordance with Discord's developer policy**, all the data that she collects are necessary for the good functioning of Loritta. If you want to read Discord's developer policy, [click here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy)!

## A person said that Loritta sells the messages that I send!
This person is lying. Loritta does not sell your information and would never do that.

Do not believe in such lies, when a person says that to you, demand that they prove to you why Loritta sells your information, investigate the proofs and analyze to discover if it is really true. (Of course, it is not true, but it is cool to find lies in people's proofs just for you to rub in their faces)

Other bots bigger than Loritta, that you do not have access to the source code, that possess links with companies of questionable quality and with not very pleasant history continue to exist and several people trust these bots... why should you believe that *Loritta* sells your data, then?

And stop to think a little, several people use Loritta and she is in several servers, she must receive many messages per second, which would be completely unfeasible to keep all the messages that she receives!

## And how can I be sure that Loritta does not collect anything beyond that?
Loritta has her code open for anyone to see, mess with and even help to develop Loritta: [https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta)
