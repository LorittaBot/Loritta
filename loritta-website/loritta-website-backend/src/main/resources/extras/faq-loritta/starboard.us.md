The starboard is a text channel that you can configure in my [control panel](/dashboard) so that messages reacted by a certain number of star emojis (<img src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/2b50.png" class="inline-emoji">) chosen by you appear there. Don't know how to react a message? [Click here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041139231-Adding-Emojis-and-Reactions) then to see Discord's official tutorial.

You can do this so that funny messages are highlighted, so that members of your server vote in a more beautiful drawing reacting with the star in the message, etc. Use creativity! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/727583763646644225.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

3. When you are in the Starboard module, just configure the text channel that will appear the highlighted messages and the number of stars that you want that be necessary for the highlight. All done! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
