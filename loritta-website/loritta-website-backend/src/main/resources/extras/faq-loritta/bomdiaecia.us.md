For those who don't know what the TV show Bom Dia & Cia is, well, you didn't have a childhood and I won't explain. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/763231811723460629.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

In my Good Morning & Co. system I announce in the text channels of your server, when there are people chatting in it, that the lines are open. "What do you mean? <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/500751183972007941.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">". When I announce, I will send a highlighted command together with the message, like this one here: "`+call 4002-8922 I don't want to win a game of life, I want to win a playstation two!`" (these are the calls). Whoever manages to execute the call command that I announced first in all servers that have this system enabled will win a prize in dreams (my economy) that can vary the quantity! 

When someone wins I announce the name of the winner and the server he won to all servers that I announced that lines were open, and I also show to the winner from how many people he won, who are the people from whom he won by typing faster and the number of words he typed per minute! 

You cannot copy and paste the phrase that I announced, do not try to call without me having announced the program and do not call if a person already won. If you try to do this you will fail miserably and you will be throwing your dreams away... since each call costs **75 dreams**! 

The message below is an example of an announcement of Good Morning & Co. that I make. Unfortunately I am not yet rich enough to give a PlayStation to everyone who calls first in Good Morning & Co.... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886251855872.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

In this FAQ you will find how to enable the Good Morning & Co. system in your server, all the phrases that I can announce and the relation between my clusters system and Good Morning & Co.

## How do I enable the system in my server?
1. Access the control panel of your server by [clicking here](/dashboard) or using the command `+panel` in your server.
![1st step](/v3/assets/img/faq/servers.png)

2. Upon accessing the panel, search for the Miscellaneous module in the list of modules to your left. Found it? Then click.
![2nd step](/v3/assets/img/faq/find_module.png)

3. Search for Good Morning & Co. Next to it there will be a button like this one "<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/769354477525401611.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">" for you to enable the system. Upon enabling, click on Save and done! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> Under the option of Good Morning & Co. you will also find the Tosco Mode, which is a mode where I release jokes and random reactions in your chat when there are people chatting in it.

## Clusters and Good Morning & Co.
If you don't know what my clusters system is and want to know what it is, then [click here](/extras/faq-loritta/clusters-and-shards) that I will redirect you to my other FAQ page. 

The influence that it exercises on my Good Morning & Co. system is that servers from one cluster cannot compete for calls with servers from other clusters. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886251855872.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> If you want to know which cluster and which shard your server is located, just use the command `+ping`.
