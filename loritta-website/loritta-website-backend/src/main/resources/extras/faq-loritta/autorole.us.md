The autorole is a system where I give one or more roles, defined by you, to a member that just arrived in your server! Next there will be a tutorial of how to configure this system in your server.

**Attention**: Configuring an automatic role may result in the malfunctioning of the verification level of the server depending on your settings. If you want to keep the verification level working well, I recommend that you enable the option to give the role only when the new member sends a message in the server.

## Configuring the Autorole
1. Access the control panel of your server by [clicking here](/dashboard) or using the command `+panel` in your server.

2. Upon accessing the panel, you will start by the General Configuration module. Search then for the Autorole module in the list to your left.

3. When you are already in the Autorole module, enable the module and you will already be able to start configuring. Select the role(s) that you want me to give to the new members of the server and, if you want, establish a time (in seconds) so that I give the role to the new member or enable the option for me to give the role only when he sends a message. All done! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
