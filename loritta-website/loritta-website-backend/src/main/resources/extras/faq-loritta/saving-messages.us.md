Your day is wonderful! You got a 10 in the school exam, won thousands of dreams playing in SparklyPower... and on top of that the 10/10 cutie accepted your request of marriage in Loritta! Nothing can spoil your day!

Until you receive a report that a user is breaking the rules of your server, but he admitted this in a private message.

And then for the rest of the day you live with that doubt in your head... "How am I going to know if the person is not trying to trick me with a fake proof?" <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/769189717887025203.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

Well, now there is a way for you to manage to validate if the proof that they passed to you is true, with Loritta's authenticated messages! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1167125529024012389.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## How to Save Messages
Ok, now that you already know about this incredible functionality, how about learning to use it in your favor? To save a message of a miscreant click with the right button in any message and select the option of "Save Message"!

![Button to save the message](/v3/assets/img/faq/saving_messages/2.png)

There exist two options to save:
- **Save Message (Send Here)**: Sends the image publicly in the current channel. Remembering that, everyone will be able to see Loritta's message with the generated image.
- **Save Message (Send in DM)**: Sends the image in your DM, this is useful for reports without the person that is being reported discovering <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/1012854272817381487.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">!

Upon clicking on it, Loritta saves a "screenshot" of the image and, with a pinch of ✨ magic ✨ that only Loritta knows, keeps the data of the message inside the image, thus being able to confirm that the message is real!

In this way, any other person of Discord that has the link or the original image generated by Loritta (and that also utilizes her, right? ;P) will be able to confirm that the message that you are alleging to be real, is real reeaalllly.

## Verifying Authenticity
Now that you learned to save an image you ask yourself: "How can I verify or say to people that my image is real?". To verify that the message is real and receive information about the sent message, just use `/verifymessage url ImageLink`.

That is, even if the person meticulously edits the image that Loritta generates to make a fake proof that seems 100% veridical, you still manage to verify that the image is real! Isn't it incredible?? <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886432473098.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

If you are from the moderation team of a server, validating reports becomes much easier! Just you ask for who is reporting to save the message by Loritta and send the image for you! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/864111506635227136.gif" class="inline-emoji">


## Help! This command does not appear for me!
If the command does not appear for you, we have some alternatives that maybe are causing this:

- You are trying to save messages in a "Direct messages" channel. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/950111543574536212.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
