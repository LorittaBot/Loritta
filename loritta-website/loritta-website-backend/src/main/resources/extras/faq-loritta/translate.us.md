To help more people use and have fun with <span class="discord-mention">@Loritta</span>, we need to translate her into other languages so she can grow and be even happier! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/524893994874961940.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji">    
Translating content into multiple languages is complicated since the work is done manually. So, we kindly ask that if you are fluent in a language, please help us translate Loritta!   

## But... what do I get for translating her?
* ~~Fame and Glory!~~~  

You will get:
* An exclusive role on Loritta's server!
* An exclusive badge on Lori's +profile! <img src="https://abs.twimg.com/emoji/v2/72x72/1f30e.png" class="inline-emoji">
* Your name will appear in +language!
* And maybe more things in the future! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886432473098.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

However, to keep these perks, you need to be an active translator. (This means whenever there are new updates for Lori, go ahead and translate the texts for the new features).

## Which languages can I translate her into?
Any language you are truly fluent in!

## Okay, how do I translate?

Don't hesitate to ask our support team on the [community & support server](/support), they are there just to answer your questions. Don't forget to mention the <span style="color: rgb(9, 164, 216); background-color: rgba(9, 164, 216, 0.1);" class="discord-mention">@💁📑 Suporte da Lori</span> role if you have any doubts!

To translate her, just access our site on [Crowdin](https://loritta.crowdin.com/), choose the Loritta project and the language you wish to translate, and start translating right in your browser! You can also choose to download the files to translate and then import them back to Crowdin! (Please use a decent text editor like Sublime Text, Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, etc., to ensure your translation doesn't "break").

Be honest with yourself! Avoid translating phrases you feel insecure about. If that happens, you can try joining our community server to consult with other translators!

If you are translating to English, you can also translate all the new updates from [<span class="discord-mention">#📢│novidades</span>](https://discord.gg/lori) to post on Lori's international server, but this is optional... however, if you want to, just let <span class="discord-mention">@MrPowerGamerBR😘|💁Lori creator</span> know in our server. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/727631176432484473.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## Yay! I helped translate, but... My name doesn't appear on the translator list.

Don't get discouraged, young grasshopper! There is a very easy method to add your name there. Just make a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) on our [locales repository](https://github.com/LorittaBot/LorittaLocales), adding your Discord ID to the list in the `/{language-folder}/translators.yml` file (check the default folder for an example!).

In the Pull Request, add a link to your Crowdin profile. Credited users are shown in the `+language` command and receive a special role on Loritta's support server!

Remember that we will only accept it if we think you really helped and if your contribution was substantial! You won't be accepted if you only help with a few translations, and if necessary, we might remove many of your translations (please, do not use Google Translate, we know if you used it).

See below for an example of how to add your ID to the Translators list:
```yml
