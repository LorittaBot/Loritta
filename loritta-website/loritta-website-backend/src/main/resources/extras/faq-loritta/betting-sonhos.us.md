One of the ways to use your dreams is betting. Either with another person or with me, you can come out profiting many dreams! Don't know what dreams are? Then [click here](/extras/faq-loritta/sonhos). Next you will see all the ways to bet your dreams.

## Coinflip: `+coinflip bet`
Use the command `+coinflip bet @user amount` to bet any amount of dreams with another person or even with me! It is enough that the two people have the amount of dreams being betted. There exists 50% of chance of each of the users in a coinflip bet bet winning the dreams of the game, and no, there is no way to "bug" this chance (if you still believe in "coinflip bug", [click here](/extras/faq-loritta/coinflip-bug)

If you want to bet your dreams with me, just mention me in the bet and react as if you were betting with a normal user, I just can't guarantee you that I will have dreams at the moment of the bet, since I live #bankrupt because of the people that wipe me out... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886251855872.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> You can donate to me using `+pay @Loritta#0219 amount` so that I have dreams to bet.

## Lorifa: `+lorifa buy`
Use the command `+lorifa` to see information about the raffle that is happening at this moment. If you want to buy a ticket to try your luck in it, use `+lorifa buy quantity` (each ticket costs 250 dreams). Know that you need to redeem your [daily dreams](/daily) to be able to bet in the raffle lol. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593979718919913474.png" class="inline-emoji">

Just like all betting commands, the lorifa is a probability game. Who bets more doesn't win, who has the luck of being drawn by me wins, but if you bet more than everyone else you will have more chance of winning than everyone else who is in the raffle round. 

Example: There are 100 tickets in the round and 20 are mine, 60 yours and 20 of other people. I have 20% of winning, you have 60% and the other people, 20%. It is not certain that you will win, but you will have more chance than everyone else of coming out as winner.

My raffles do not possess fixed time for duration, but on average it is one hour. No need to be worried about using the command every time to see if you won, because I myself will warn you in private if you win! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/731873534036541500.png" class="inline-emoji">

## Scratch Card: `+raspadinha buy`
Use the command `+raspadinha buy` to buy a scratch card. To know how it works, know the prizes that I can give you when buying a scratch card and know your scratch card betting statistics, use just `+raspadinha`. 

Pay close attention when redeeming the prize of a scratch card, since if you try to redeem the prize of a non-winning scratch card, I will take 1,000 dreams from your wallet. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/395010059157110785.png" class="inline-emoji">

These are the probabilities of each emoji appearing in your message:

## Emoji Fight: `+emojifight bet`
Use the command `+emojifight bet amount` to bet any amount of dreams with other users. The emoji fight is as if it were a coinflip bet, only cooler, since it allows more than two people in the bet! You also need to redeem your [daily dreams](/daily) to be able to bet in the fight.

When using the command, I will give 60 seconds for the members of the server to react on the message to participate in the fight. The fight may start before in case its creator reacts on the check mark or if the fight reaches its user limit, which by default is 30 (you can limit the quantity of people in the bet including the quantity after the amount). 

If you do not possess dreams to bet or just want to have fun, you can create an emoji fight without bet! Use just `+emojifight` and let the brawl begin. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/731871119400894525.gif" class="inline-emoji">

## Guessing numbers: `+guessnumber number`
Use `+guessnumber number` to try to guess which number, from 1 to 10, I am thinking at that moment. If you get it right, you will win 1,000 dreams. If you get it wrong, you will lose 115 dreams.
