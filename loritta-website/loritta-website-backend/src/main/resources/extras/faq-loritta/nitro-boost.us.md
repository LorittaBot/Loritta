Want to help my server to earn incredible and interesting functionalities? Then you came to the right place!

## "Boost? Is it something to eat?"
Boost is something that Discord created so that users can reward their favorite servers with exclusive functionalities, like: more slots for emojis, banners, animated icons and even customized invites!

Users that pay for Nitro of 9.99$ receive two free boosts to give in any server that they want, but it is possible to buy additional boosts for 4.99$ (3.49$ if you already are Nitro) in the server boosting screen.

For more information or to give a boost, [click here](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-). <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/633770642159829006.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## "What do I win upon boosting Loritta's server?"
Each boost that you give in a server of our server list you earn the advantages of who donated 19.99 reais to me! See all the advantages by [clicking here](/donate).

Remember: You only earn the advantages if you give the boost before the server has more than 25 boosts, in case the server has more than 25 boosts, you will not earn the rewards! 

## "aaaa why do I need to give two boosts to earn the advantages of 40 reais?"
In distant times, each Nitro only had one boost to use. As Discord Nitro costs approximately 39.99 reais, the advantages of who boosted was the same of who donated 39.99 reais and inclusive boosters earned 3 dreams per minute.

Times changed and Discord resolved to give two boosts for each one to use, but the value of who boosted here continued being 39.99 reais! Without counting that it doesn't help the server much when it already has more than 30+ boosts in the server, since boosts do not pay my bills. <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/729723959284727808.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

That is why we decided to lower the value of each boost to 19.99 reais and free the advantage of earning dreams per minute to all donors. That is, each boost in a LorittaLand server counts as 19.99 reais! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## "I have more than one boost and I want to earn more donor advantages, can I?"
Yes! But Discord does not let us know if you gave more than one boost in the server, so you will have to... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/524933940465893376.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> **boost another LorittaLand server**! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/524933940465893376.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

Upon boosting one of these servers, I will consider that you donated +20 reais! (Of course, you can also boost some Lorittaland server and I will also consider that you donated 20 reais)

To balance, we recommend that you boost the server that is closer to getting the next boost level and avoid servers that already attained level 3 of boost.

In case all servers already have attained, we will put more servers in the list (maybe even servers of yours!) to help distribute boosts out there! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/640158506049077280.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

## "I am earning dreams without even doing anything! What can it be?"
One of the advantages of who donates 19.99+ reais is earning 2 dreams per minute.

The advantage is cumulative, that is, if you donate 39.99 reais you will earn 4 dreams per minute, and so it goes.

Servers that possess a donor key with value of R$ 99.99+ also possess this advantage! Boosters in servers that possess the key activated earn 2 dreams per minute.

## "I wanted to have my advantages of 39.99 reais back or have bigger donor advantages, but I didn't want to spend money with boosts, can I?"
Yes! You can mix your boost (that counts as donation) with donations made in my website!

That is, if you have a boost here and you donated 19.99 reais, I will consider that you donated 39.99 reais, thus you will have the advantages of who donates 39.99 reais (Like, for example, not paying taxes in `+coinflip bet`, `+raffle` and in other things of mine).

## Server list to boost
Enter in my [community server](https://discord.gg/lori) and search for the text channel <span class="discord-mention">#🚀│nitro-boosters</span> to see the list. Already there and want practicality? Then [click here](https://discord.com/channels/297732013006389252/663098645767258113/681474891870240769) (it is the message link). 

I recommend that you always verify if the server that is in this list has less than 25 boosts, since sometimes I can commit mistakes and put servers that already passed 25. To err is human, right, but in my case... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886461833217.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
