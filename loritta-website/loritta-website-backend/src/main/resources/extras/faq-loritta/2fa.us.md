Two-Factor Authentication (also known as Two-Step Authentication or 2FA) is a feature of Discord (and other platforms). The name is "Two-Step Authentication" because, at the time you try to log in, it will ask for a code generated by your mobile phone (Thus being two steps: One which is your email/password, another which is the code). 2FA is extremely useful for protecting your account against hackers who managed to get your email and password, since they would also have to have your mobile phone to be able to log in, thus giving you a chance to configure a new password before the hacker manages to invade your account.

When utilizing some functionalities of Loritta, she may ask you to enable Two-Factor Authentication to be able to perform the action, for example:
* When collecting daily with suspicious IPs
* When buying something on the Loritta website
* Among others...

The goal of Loritta asking that your account has Two-Factor Authentication enabled on your account is to avoid the creation of alt/fake accounts.

Some people do not wish to enable Two-Factor Authentication fearing that they lose the account in case the cell phone breaks or gets stolen, but the solution for such problems is simple: In Discord it is possible for you to download backup codes after enabling Two-Factor Authentication, you can utilize the backup codes to enter and remove Two-Factor Authentication in case you lose access to your cell phone! Just keep the codes in a safe place, like on a sheet of paper.

Loritta will not have access to your mobile phone number or personal information of yours after enabling Two-Factor Authentication, Discord does not make this information available to bots, and Loritta is not even interested in knowing your mobile phone number, no matter how much you wanted her contact on WhatsApp.
