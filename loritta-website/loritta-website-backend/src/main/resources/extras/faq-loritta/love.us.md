## Shipping couples: `+ship @user @user`
{{ renderDiscordMessage("ship_artitta.html", "no_tooltips.conf") }}

To ship two users, just use the command mentioning both: `+ship @user @user`. I will show the percentage chance of the couple working out and their ship name!

The percentage chance can change in two ways: if one of the users in the ship changes their name on Discord or if one of the users bribes the love oracle! "What do you mean love oracle, Lori? Are you crazy? <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/592037845229633572.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">". Don't know him? Then I'll teach you how to bribe him.

1. Access the Ship Values Editor section of the dashboard by [clicking here](/user/@me/dashboard/ship-effects). Upon accessing, you will see the following page:

2. Scroll down the page and you will find the spaces to fill in the Discord Tag or the User ID and the desired percentage.

3. After filling it out, click on `Buy`! Each bribe, as it says on the website, costs 3,000 dreams and it will last for 7 days. After these 7 days pass, you will have to bribe again if you want to keep the percentage. If you don't renew the bribe, a new random percentage will be generated for the ship.

4. **This step 4 is only for those who couldn't use the bribe due to the "Unknown user" error**. If this happens to you, try using the user ID. You can get a user's ID using the command `+userinfo @user` or using Discord itself ([click here](https://support.discord.com/hc/pt-br/articles/206346498-Onde-posso-encontrar-minhas-IDs-de-Usu%C3%A1rio-Servidor-Mensagem-) to see the Discord tutorial).

## Getting married: `+marry @user`
You can marry a user using the command `+marry @user`. Your union will appear on your `+profile`, along with the duration of the marriage, for other people to see that you are taken.

When marrying someone, you will automatically get 100% when using the `+ship` command on you two! Also, you and your soulmate will get two badges on your `+profile` (one of them will only be available after 1 month of marriage). Want to know more about badges? [Click here](/extras/faq-loritta/profile-badges-meanings)!

It is necessary to pay 7,500 dreams to marry someone and pay 250 dreams daily to be able to sustain the marriage. The daily fee dreams are automatically withdrawn from your account at 19:00. Unfortunately, nothing in life is free... <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886251855872.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> Use the `+dreams` command to see how many you have.
