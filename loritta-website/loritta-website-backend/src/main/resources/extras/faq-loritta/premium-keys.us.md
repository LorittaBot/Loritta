Premium keys are passes for advantages in my functions that you earn to activate in your server. Usually they last 30 days. All the advantages are listed in my <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/737016464887906375.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji"> [donation page](/donate) <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/737016464887906375.gif?v=1" class="inline-emoji">, but they are only the advantages related to server, they do not give advantages to the users themselves.

## How do I get a premium key?

* Buy my premium by [clicking here](/donate). <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/593979718919913474.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
* Vote for me on [Discord Bot List](https://discordbots.org/bot/loritta).
* Give boosts in Lorittaland servers ([click here](/extras/faq-loritta/nitro-boost) to know more).

Every 60 votes you earn a key of R$199.00 reais for your server, with duration of 30 days. Only donors of more than R$19.99 reais earn keys for servers. You can earn up to R$40.00 reais in key with the boosts.

## How do I activate a premium key?
1. Access the control panel of your server by [clicking here](/dashboard) or using the command `+panel` in your server.

2. Upon accessing the panel, you will start by the General Configuration module. Search then for the Premium Keys module in the list to your left.

3. When you are already in the Premium Keys module, just choose which key you want to activate and then activate. In this module of the server will appear all the active keys in the server that you are configuring and all the keys that you possess. When activating, click on `Save`. All done! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/519546310978830355.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">

### Dreams Multiplier & Custom Badge
The **dreams multiplier** is an advantage for the members that chat frequently in your server. Premium keys with value starting from R$19.99 possess multipliers. The daily of these members will be multiplied by a number defined by the active key in the server. See the following table:

| R$00.00 | R$19.99 | R$39.99 | R$99.99 |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1x      | 1.25x   | 1.5x    | 2x      |

To obtain a **custom badge** for the members of your server, your premium key needs to have value of R$39.99 (Recommended Plan). Don't know what badges are? Then [click here](/extras/faq-loritta/profile-badges-meanings)! So that it appears on your `+profile`, you need to send a message in the server after configured and after each restart of mine.

Both premium advantages are found in the control panels of your server:
