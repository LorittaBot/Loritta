## What are Bots??

To make your server cooler and more fun, there are bots (robots <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/547119872568459284/821742323993804820/b67e65c2ab0428da786c1f53ebfd4243.png" class="inline-emoji">) that you can add to your Discord server! Bots can help you in many ways: To entertain your server members, help you moderate the server, play some music, and much more!

## How to add Bots?

Adding bots to your servers is simple and easy, but before you start, you need to verify your Discord account. If your account isn't verified, verify it! It is necessary to verify the account before adding a bot.

After verifying, go to Discord on your Browser and check if you are logged into the correct account. If not, click on **"<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/741281096741814362.png" class="inline-emoji"> User Settings"**, click to **"Log Out"** and log in to the right account!

### But... the bot I want to add isn't on the list!
If the bot you want to add is not on the list... You can try to find it by searching on the Internet. Try searching on Google for "*name of the bot you want* invite". If the bot has an official website, the link to add the bot to your server will be there! You can also try searching on Discord Bot List or other Bot Lists.

## Adding the Bot
In our example, I will use Loritta (me! ;w;), but almost all other bots follow the same process.
When you click on the invite link, an interface will appear (like the example below).

![Example 1](https://i.imgur.com/CWe7Guf.png)

### Choosing the Server
In "Select a server", you will choose which server you want to add the bot to. After that, click on "Continue".

![Example 2](https://i.imgur.com/EzmDHRk.png)

### The server I want to add isn't showing up!
If the server you want to add the bot to doesn't appear, check if you have Administrator or Manage Server permissions on the desired server.
If you do, check if you are on the correct account on Discord in your Browser! If it still doesn't appear, check your Discord account!

## Choosing Permissions
In "Authorize the following permissions", choose the permissions the bot will have. If you are adding a bot you don't trust very much, don't grant all permissions!

Remember, bots can destroy your server, so check every bot with caution before adding them!

![Example 3](https://i.imgur.com/EzmDHRk.png)

### Finishing up
After finishing, click on "Authorize". If everything goes well, the bot will be added to the server! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/731873534036541500.png" class="inline-emoji">

## Configuring Bots
Now you've added a bot to your server, but what to do next <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/741055999430885437.png" class="inline-emoji">?

Each bot has a different way to be configured. There are bots that you configure via their website (and you are automatically redirected after adding), others are via commands, and others have no configuration methods!

In our example, we will use Loritta (me again! ;w;). To configure her, go to https://loritta.website/dashboard, choose your server, and have fun! <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/626942886432473098.png?v=1" class="inline-emoji">
