Any project you create, even if you don't realize it, has the story of how it was created and how it reached success, and this applies to Loritta as well. Even before her first appearance on Discord on 03/30/2017, she had a great history behind her until she reached the success she is today!

I (MrPowerGamerBR) always thought the possibility of automating and interacting through your favorite chat platform was cool, with bots that are useful, entertain you, and help you during your day-to-day life. But unfortunately, the chat platforms I used at the time didn't allow for bot creation in an easy and official way, which made me put that idea aside...

But that doesn't mean I wasn't already messing with programming before creating Loritta! On the contrary, one of the reasons Loritta existed was thanks to [SparklyPower](https://sparklypower.net/), my Minecraft Survival server. And thanks to Minecraft and SparklyPower, I started messing with Java in August 2014! Without SparklyPower, Loritta might never have existed and wouldn't have reached where she is today.

The story tells all the progress up to the moment Loritta was released to the public on 04/12/2017. I decided to write the story so I would never forget how her progress went, since stories that aren't written down have their details forgotten and lost forever... That's why the story is a bit long and convoluted, pleasing only myself, but maybe it will be inspiring and interesting for you!

## The exploits of creating bots for Skype

SparklyBot already existed as a system in the SparklyPower chat to answer dumb and silly questions from players, christened as "the system to remove everyone from the staff" since it answered various player doubts on the server.

Since programming the same thing over and over starts to get boring (burnout, like anything you end up doing for too long), I decided to program something different, something I had never done before... So why not do something on Skype?

At the time, creating bots for Skype was harder than making bots for Discord, since there was no official API for bot creation, so you had to keep using workarounds, reverse engineering, and various libraries that were unstable. And the worst part is that 2015 was in the middle of the migration from P2P Skype to Web Skype, and most Skype groups were still P2P, which supported moderation commands... but most libraries only supported Web Skype.

While in 2015 I didn't mess much with Skype bots, in 2016 I did more and, even with all these problems, [at the end of June 2016 I tried to create a lightweight client for Skype called SkyKaty, inspired by MSN, which I ended up giving up on later](https://youtu.be/woBsJx3Tq5w) (remember how Skype was extremely heavy and unstable, to the point of being unusable when you had many contacts?) and, in early August 2016, I created "SparklyBot" on Skype!

SparklyBot's peculiar avatar comes from [this video](https://youtu.be/XO62414Gj6Y), edited to have my friend's photo on top. How did I discover this video? I think it was because some YouTube Poop at the time had used the video.

And even with all these limitations, I tried to make a bot with interesting features!

* Accept any friend request sent to it and, after accepting, send a message talking about SparklyPower
* Command to send a private message to all of SparklyBot's contacts
* See how many players are online on SparklyPower

* See what SparklyPower's website is by typing `qual é o website do SparklyPower` (what is SparklyPower's website)
* How to beg for an unban by typing `me desbane` (unban me)
* How to download the SparklyPower launcher by typing `como baixa o launcher do SparklyPower`
* And it also answered all the questions that SparklyBot already answered in the SparklyPower chat

But not everything was just automating things to help people! It also had some fun and funny stuff!

* Angry SparklyBot, because sending `vai se fuder` (go f*ck yourself) made SparklyBot reply with `É ESSA A BOCA QUE VOCÊ FALA COM A SUA MÃE?` (IS THAT THE MOUTH YOU USE TO TALK TO YOUR MOTHER?)

* Creation of new silly phrases based on messages sent in the SparklyPower chat, generated using Markov chains.

* Funky SparklyBot, because `manda um batidão SparklyBot` (drop a beat SparklyBot) made it reply with a song by [MC João and MC Hariel](https://youtu.be/T5KGEc6LooA)

   </a>
</div>

And that's how SparklyBot lived. It didn't have as many features compared to bots that exist today for Discord, but that was due to the limitations of the libraries that existed at the time.

But little did SparklyBot know that soon it would be migrated to another place...

## Bye Skype... and Hello, Discord!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/avatar.png" target="_blank">

In January 2017, I got tired of using Skype due to the number of problems and instabilities it had, since it took almost five minutes for my computer to become usable after Skype opened and, even after all that, it continued to crash on its own for no reason.

We had already tried creating a SparklyPower server on Discord at the end of 2015, but it fell into disuse since everyone preferred using Skype. But due to the problems Skype was having, on 01/02/2017 we decided to give Discord a second chance. I ended up creating a new server on Discord for SparklyPower (since I wasn't the owner of the old server) and I realized that the old server had bots... But wait? Bots?

And then I ended up discovering that Discord officially supported the creation of bots for the platform and also had a documented API. So on the same day, I created SparklyBot and started remaking SparklyBot's functionalities from Skype to Discord.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/ping.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/ping.png" />
   </a>
</div>

Since the libraries that exist for Discord are better than the libraries that existed for Skype (after all, with an API officially supported by the platform creators, it is much easier to develop something), SparklyBot ended up having features that were impossible to make with the libraries that existed for Skype!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/hello.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/hello.png" />
   </a>
</div>

And all of this was done before I even messed with *any* bot for Discord, while I had made bots on other servers, I had never used them. In fact, one of the first bots I used was [Septapus](http://septapus.com/), a bot that was officially recommended by the Discord team.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/septapus.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/septapus.png" />
   </a>
</div>

The most interesting thing nowadays is to compare the list of features, you end up realizing that several features that SparklyBot had were added to Loritta!

* Command that generates a message in ｖａｐｏｒｗａｖｅ style

   </a>
</div>

* Fight Event, based on the Fight Event that exists on SparklyPower, after a while it was changed so you didn't have to keep putting the attack numbers and moved to a different channel to avoid floods.

</div>

* A help command so simple that Loritta's commands page puts it to shame.

* Command that shows a person's avatar
* Command that shows a Minecraft account skin
* Command that shows a random fan art of the ~~best fluffy boi that ever existed~~ [Asriel Dreemurr](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Asriel_Dreemurr).

* Sending the "ata" meme image every time someone said "ata" (ah ok)... If you thought "isn't that annoying?": Yes, it is annoying and ended up being removed.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/ata.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/ata.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* A command that sent a random part of ~~PresoCasa~~ [Homestuck](https://www.homestuck.com/)... I never read Homestuck, but a person from the SparklyPower team had asked me to make a command for it.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/homestuck.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/homestuck.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* Music System! I never liked listening to music via Discord (I like to listen to my music in peace), but since it was possible to do it I decided to implement it just for "haha I know how to make a bot with music and you don't".

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/music.png" target="_blank">

   </a>
</div>

* Several "silliness" features like automatically reacting to random messages as well as sending "kk eae men" (hey man) in the middle of conversations.

And so SparklyBot lived happily, but even so it didn't have many features aimed at SparklyPower compared to the Skype SparklyBot, but people still loved SparklyBot's funny commands...

...and some people liked it so much, they wanted SparklyBot in their servers.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/sparklybot_discord/flood.png" target="_blank">

## People want it, time to create a public bot for Discord!

While SparklyBot's goal was to be a bot with features related to SparklyPower, SparklyBot ended up having some cool features that caught the attention of other people who also wanted to have SparklyBot's features in their servers... So it was time to make something to supply these people's needs!

There were four reasons for me to continue with the bot idea and make a bot:

* I wanted to remake SparklyBot because its source code was messy, since it was the first bot I made and was more for me to experiment with what it was like to make bots than something serious.
* A friend of mine (Pandinhaaa) who played on SparklyPower wanted a bot for her Discord server about her SparklyPower club, but what she wanted (configuring commands that send ready-made messages) wasn't in SparklyBot.
* If my bot was successful, I could put a small advertisement for SparklyPower in the bot's help command, thus bringing more players to SparklyPower! Ahhh, the good old "Commercial Break"...
* I was tired of making things for SparklyPower, as I was working on a reset for the server (remember kids: NEVER reset your projects from scratch, you will regret it!) and was waiting for the new dedicated server I bought to arrive.

And thus ~~Loritta~~ TavaresBot appeared!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/tavaresbot/creation.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/tavaresbot/creation.png" />

Yeah... Loritta's original name wasn't Loritta, it was TavaresBot. Tavares is the last name of a school friend, [and the bot's avatar photo was also his photo](https://youtu.be/8R2W53f-0N8).

But even so, I was confident in continuing with the idea, so much so that I even said it would be the "best public Brazilian bot"! Of course, the competition back then was practically *no one*, I didn't know of any other bot made by a Brazilian at the time, except for bots from other SparklyPower players.

Of course, nowadays I know that at the time there were other bots made by Brazilians... but the only ones that survived since then were Loritta and [Pollux](https://vanilla.pollux.gg/).

<div class="centered-text">

   </a>
</div>

One of the ideas was for the bot to change its avatar depending on the day of the week, thus varying the bot a bit. The idea was discarded right at the beginning and was never implemented, but there are still remnants of four of the seven avatars that would be used during the week.

</div>

But if you are smart, you might have noticed that part of this idea was reused for Loritta's "Fan Arts Extravaganza", where she changes her avatar to show Fan Arts on Sundays!

{{ in_content_ad("creating-a-public-bot") }}

## A new name for the Bot, because TavaresBot is too lame

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/new_names/temporary.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/new_names/temporary.png" />
   </a>
</div>

And soon after it was decided that TavaresBot was a temporary name until I decided on a better name, after all, what would my friend do if he found out I was using a photo of him and his last name in a *bot for Discord*?

I wanted a name with a word in Portuguese, so people would know right away that it's a bot made by a Brazilian and add it to their servers...

And then came the flood of suggestions made by SparklyPower players: PowerBot, PortuguêsBot, BrilhoBot, HueBot, MineirinhoBot, ForeverAloneBot, XablauBot, DilmaBot, EscravoBot, ChaveBot, BotDasQuebra, PesadaumBot, IrineuBot, MiauuBot... Various suggestions, some even good, but none was a name that I felt *deserved* to be the bot's name.

I had thought of ForninhoBot (reference to the ["Eita Giovana, o forninho caiu!" meme](https://youtu.be/rK1qOxn7Rdk)), FurdúncioBot (reference to [Fluffy from Treta News](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfk5MMR4k6ulPmvvzkGe5kg)), FarofaBot (because I love farofa)...

And then I decided I would use FarofaBot!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/new_names/farofabot.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/new_names/farofabot.png" />
   </a>
</div>

So the bot's name was chosen! ...but even so I wasn't *feeling* that this name was good, after all, "FarofaBot" would look weird since Discord already shows the "Bot" tag, it's kind of redundant. So time to go back to thinking of a name, this time without "Bot" and abandoning the "words in Portuguese" idea.

So I thought, and went looking for characters I know, and then the name *almost* was [Katy](https://parappatherapper.fandom.com/wiki/Katy_Kat), [Paula](https://parappatherapper.fandom.com/wiki/Paula_Fox), [Nicole](https://theamazingworldofgumball.fandom.com/wiki/Nicole_Watterson) (SparklyPower already had "Nicole" on the server, she appeared in club notifications, for example: when someone joined, left, was promoted, etc), [Carlotta](https://icarly.fandom.com/wiki/Carly_Shay)... But I ended up deciding to use Lori, a reference to [Lori Jackrabbit](https://www.jazz2online.com/wiki/Lori_Jackrabbit), a character from the game Jazz Jackrabbit 2.

But there are already many Loris when searching for "Lori" on Google and GitHub, and that would make her growth quite difficult since searching for her on Google would be hard, as it is important to give a unique name to your project to prevent your project from dying just because no one can find information about it on Google...

So I decided to combine Lori and Carlotta to create a unique name that (almost) no one used in their life, a catchy name, that sounds Latin and was something people like...

# Welcome, Loritta!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/loritta_is_born.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/loritta_is_born.png" />
   </a>
</div>

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/roll.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/roll.png" />
   </a>
</div>

And thus the name "Loritta" appeared, and one of Loritta's first commands was the dice roll command!

At the time the "character" Loritta didn't exist yet, so the excuse was that Loritta didn't like using her own photo on Discord, so she did like everyone who doesn't like using their own photo does: Uses photos of characters they like! And since I like Katy Kat, Loritta ended up using Katy Kat as an avatar too!

In the beginning Loritta was using this fan art of Katy Kat as an avatar, but I wasn't liking the sepia effect of the image and all my attempts to remove the effect were in vain... Unfortunately I didn't find who made the Fan Art and trying to reverse image search on Google didn't help to find it...

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/tumblr_okq8b8ijCl1qk7kqco1_1280.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/tumblr_okq8b8ijCl1qk7kqco1_1280.jpg" />
   </a>
</div>

At the time, while I was reverse searching images, I ended up finding [a Fan Art of Katy Kat made by gasterkei](https://gasterkei.tumblr.com/post/158758445671/youve-been-blessed-by-the-angel-katy) that was so beautiful but so random that I ended up loving it, and thus Loritta's avatar appeared!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="https://gasterkei.tumblr.com/post/158758445671/youve-been-blessed-by-the-angel-katy" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/tumblr_onamgcN0Yb1vyqyl8o1_500.png" />
   </a>
</div>

And now it was time to get my hands dirty and develop Loritta, until I thought she already had enough features to be released to the public, and so it went, adding features never seen before and migrating features from SparklyBot to Loritta! And you will be surprised how some of the features that so many people use today on Loritta were created when she was born!

* Faustão! Ô loco bixo! (Wow man!)

<div class="centered-text">

        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/faustao.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* I created Loritta for fun, because I thought it would be cool to create a public bot... And maybe that's where many new devs fail: Loritta took a LONG time to get to where she is today. Worry less that your bot doesn't give you money and enjoy the moment while you can. :3

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/for_fun.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/for_fun.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* I never thought Loritta would be very successful, after all, it was just a bot like any other that existed...

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/success.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/success.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* At the time the idea of making money with a Discord bot was non-existent... after all, how would *I* make money with a bot, and why would people pay to use a bot? And look there, the first appearance of the coin flip!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/no_money.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/no_money.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* Nowadays Loritta is in over a million servers, but at the time I was surprised that there are bots that are in over 100 thousand servers! There was also a small appearance of what Loritta's customizations would be like and, of course, people accusing the coin flip of being bugged. Times may change, but there will always be people accusing the coin flip of being rigged.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/bots_100k.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/bots_100k.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* The rock, paper, scissors command was also created right at the beginning of Loritta, even though the first version of the command was quite... buggy.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/ppt.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/ppt.png" />

<div class="centered-text">

        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/ppt_2.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* [Já falou tá falado, já falou tá falado. Q U A L I D A D E   &   S I N C R O N I A, se é bom tá aprovado](https://youtu.be/HtE4BrkXrEU) (It's said and done... QUALITY & SYNCHRONY), and that's how the quality command appeared... and due to a bug in the code it gave me the idea to make a command that combines the quality effect and the vaporwave effect!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/qualidade_vaporwave.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/qualidade_vaporwave.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* And the ping command! You must be thinking "but what do you mean ping command after having already made several commands, that's wrong!" and I thought the same thing too... But [looking at the command registration order in Loritta's source code](https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta/blob/29653d4468a6fbe020f67eb32ca0b2f1a9891ce2/src/com/mrpowergamerbr/loritta/commands/CommandManager.java#L51), it seems that really happened. Apparently the ping command isn't that important!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/ping.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/ping.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* And the classic avatar command that can never be missing... and we can also see the indecision of calling Loritta "her (Loritta)" or "it (the bot)".

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/avatar.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/avatar.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* And now Loritta's first command help! And topped off with a reference to South America Memes (SAM).

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/command_help.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/command_help.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* But of course, innovative ideas start to emerge... and a SparklyPower member had sent a meme in the chat that gave me an idea to make a command based on it!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/triste_realidade_meme.jpg" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/triste_realidade_meme.jpg" />

        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/triste_realidade.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* I had also made a command that sent the fan art used in her avatar... I used the excuse that it was to "test sending files that are on disk" but in reality I did it because the fan art is very cute.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/angel.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/angel.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* One of the things that couldn't be missing is a dashboard to configure Loritta, inspired by the dashboards of MEE6 and Dyno. At the time I didn't even think I could monetize Loritta with ads on the dashboard, my focus was "well I can put a SparklyPower banner there and SparklyPower will explode with players!"

* Many people are surprised that Loritta's website is `loritta.website` instead of another TLD, and the reason I bought `.website` is because... it was one of the cheapest TLDs there were.

   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/dot_website.png" target="_blank">

</div>

* Since I'm a fan of Undertale, I made a command that generates Undertale text boxes, which ended up making Undertale fans use this command for roleplay. And of course [if I created Droidtale, the unofficial port of Undertale for Android (if you played Undertale on your Android phone, it was thanks to me!)](http://mrpowergamerbr.com/projects/droidtale/), it's kind of obvious that at least ONE command related to Undertale needed to be in Loritta. :3

        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/undertalebox.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* And of course, the classic SparklyBot Treta News couldn't be missing in Loritta!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/treta_news.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/treta_news.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* Bots always have "magic ball" commands, but I wanted to make my own version of it, creating "Vieirinha", a webhook [that uses a photo of my friend from a video I was recording just for fun](https://youtu.be/wIgFFC04kQA) to answer your various questions.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/vieirinha.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/vieirinha.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* Remember the Silly Phrase from SparklyBot Skype? It's back, and now it generates new messages from the messages Loritta receives in chat!

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/frase_tosca.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/frase_tosca.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* Command to check the status of your Correios (Post Office) package, without needing to go to the Correios website just to see if your package has moved!
* Command to search for videos on YouTube!
* Command to translate texts directly through Discord!
* Command to shorten links via `bit.ly`, for when you need to shorten a link! (Which later I realized was kind of unnecessary... why would you want to shorten a link on Discord, since the character limit on Discord is extremely high? It won't be a link that will affect you when writing something...)
* South America Memes (SAM) was so popular in 2017 that I even made a command that allows placing the SAM stamp on any image you want! Nowadays this is used more ironically to say that the meme is so bad it has about three SAM logos on the image.

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/sam.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/sam.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* A command that generates a Nyan Cat of whatever size you want! This was inspired by a post on /r/discordapp that unfortunately I can't find...

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/nyan_cat.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/nyan_cat.png" />
   </a>
</div>

* There were also other commands `+emoji`, `+serverinfo` (which was inspired by Dyno's Server Info), `+limpar` (clean), `+roleid` (since at the time there was no way to see role IDs), `+offlineuuid` and two commands for me to use, `+reload` and `+changegame`.

And after all this work for thirteen days straight, on 04/12/2017, Loritta was released for anyone to add to their own servers! Several people who were active on the SparklyPower server added it to their servers or recommended Loritta to friends, while most were private test servers, some were large servers!

Yes, even with Loritta...

* Having only thirty commands, nothing compared to the 200 commands (most of them image editing, since people love that) she has today.
* Having only a dashboard that only served to change her prefix.
* Features that compared to other bots were insignificant.
* Having several other small problems.

...she was released to the public.

And people liked it, and she started to grow. Of course, it wasn't an international success overnight, it took years for her to get where she is today.

But it worked. And the rest is history! Who knows in the future there will be the "Story after Loritta's Creation"?

The character Loritta ended up only appearing on 06/11/2017, but the story of the creation of the character Loritta will be for later..

{{ in_content_ad("loritta") }}

## Final Thoughts

I hope the story was inspiring for you, it shows that everything you do can have an effect in the future, after all...

* If I hadn't gotten tired of creating things for SparklyPower, maybe Loritta wouldn't exist.
* If I hadn't migrated to Discord, maybe the Discord SparklyBot wouldn't exist.
* If I hadn't messed with unofficial APIs for Skype, maybe the Skype SparklyBot wouldn't exist.
* If I hadn't asked alexhackers (owner of TintaHost) for Minecraft hosting, maybe SparklyPower wouldn't exist.
* If I hadn't participated in the team (as owner) of DogePower and SparkPower, maybe SparklyPower wouldn't exist nor would there be a community of fans who like my work.
* If I hadn't tried to be a YouTuber in 2014, I would never have been added to a group of small YouTubers, where I ended up meeting the person who would host my and my friend's server.

Of course, Loritta had a big boost because I created Loritta before Discord started becoming popular in Brazil, but there's no use whining because you missed the opportunity, create new opportunities for yourself to grow!

If you have a bot and you're still stalling to release it, stop being a perfectionist and release it already! A public bot even if bad has much more chance of growing than a perfect bot that is private.

If you have an idea for your bot, try to do it! It's better for you to do it, see that it's bad and then remove it than for you to never create it.

Don't worry about which language you will use on your bot, but don't forget to learn programming concepts and how to solve the problems you might have. Google is a great tool for that.

Learn to break your problems into small pieces. If you want to learn how to make a "sad reality" meme like the one Loritta has you need to separate everything into small pieces so it's easier to search. After all, searching "creating sad reality meme *insert language here*" won't show anything, but searching "create empty image *insert language here*", "loading image *insert language here*", "downloading images *insert language here*", "pasting image over another image *insert language here*" will have much more useful results for you!

SparklyBot (Skype), SparklyBot (Discord) and Loritta were made in Java using the JDA library. Nowadays Loritta uses Kotlin (a language that also runs on the Java Virtual Machine, the official language for making Android apps, made by JetBrains), but still uses JDA.

Since I already had profits because of SparklyPower, SparklyBot (Skype and Discord) and Loritta were originally hosted on dedicated servers I used for SparklyPower.

## Nostalgia

<div class="centered-text">
   <a href="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/nostalgia.png" target="_blank">
        <img class="smaller-image-scale" src="/v3/assets/img/stories/how_loritta_was_created/loritta/nostalgia.png" />
   </a>
</div>

To remember the old days, there are two commemorative versions of Loritta available on the [Loritta community server](https://loritta.website/support)!

Loritta Nostalgia (2017) shows how she was on 04/24/2017, while Loritta Nostalgia (2018) shows how she was on 03/29/2018!

It is very interesting to see how she was in the past, as it is also cool for people who met Loritta recently to see how Loritta was in the beginning... and it is also inspiring to see how she grew and changed so much! The 2017 version was totally different and unrecognizable compared to Loritta nowadays, while the 2018 version is similar to Loritta nowadays, just a little less "polished".

There is still no forecast for when they will be shut down, but I intend to leave them on until there is some change in Discord that makes it difficult to fix, or if I need the resources they are using.

Have fun!
