itemsThatYouWantToBeNotified: "Items that you asked me to notify you"
notInItemShop: "The item you asked me to notify you is not sold in the Fortnite daily shop! I only notify items that are on the daily rotation of the item store, since trying to notify you about items from battle passes or promotional items would be completely useless, just like trying to drink diet Coca-Cola while you're eating a extra giant burger just because you want to \"lose weight\"."
removedTrack: "You have removed {0} from the items that you want to be notified."
trackingSuccess: "You will be notified in your direct messages when {0} returns to the daily shop. Don't forget to check if your DMs are activated so that you don't miss the notification!"
upcomingItem: "Be careful, you asked to be notified about an item that has not yet been released, I still don't know if it will be in the item store or if it will be used in any promotion, initial package or a battle pass!"
