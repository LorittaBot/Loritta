# Welcome to Loritta's configuration file!
#
# The configuration file uses HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)
# Read more at: https://github.com/lightbend/config/blob/master/HOCON.md
#
# I hope you have a nice day! Remember: Always do the right thing, make a world a better place. That's what Loritta wants in her life. :3

# Your machine external IP
# This is used when you want to share configurations between two machines, due to NAT stuff you can't connect to your external IP
# So, as an workaround, we can use this syntax for machine addresses configuration on Loritta's configure
# {external_ip/local_ip}
# Example:
# {1.2.3.4/127.0.0.1}:5432
# If Loritta detects that the current cluster external IP is "1.2.3.4", she will automatically switch to "127.0.0.1"
machine-external-ip = "1.2.3.4"
