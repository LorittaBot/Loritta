    # You know when you hardcode the emotes in the bot's source code and by mistake you delete the emote, making you need to
    # replace EVERYTHING on the source code with the new emote? That ain't fun.
    # To avoid that, Loritta stores the emotes here.bot
    # You can check all the requires emotes at: https://github.com/LorittaBot/Loritta/blob/development/loritta-api/src/commonMain/kotlin/net/perfectdreams/loritta/utils/Emotes.kt

    # "kotlin" = "discord:kotlin:453714186925637642"
    # You can also use unicode emotes!
