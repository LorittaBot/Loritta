A simple i18n web tool used to translate Loritta into other languages.

## Why not use Crowdin?

* Crowdin is expensive for our projects. It would be, at least, 50 USD monthly! And that's too dang expensive for a tool like this.
* We can integrate better with Loritta's requirements and code.
* I love reinventing the wheel! :3
