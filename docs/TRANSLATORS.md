# ðŸŒŽ Translating Loritta

Loritta wants to make the world a better place, so she needs to know to speak multiple languages to influence and win over people!

## Fixing typos in the Portuguese language

Portuguese is Loritta's default language, so its steps to fix issues are a bit different compared to translating to other languages.

The Portuguese languages files are [here](../resources/languages/pt).

First, create a fork here on GitHub, then in your fork edit the language files to fix the typos. After you are done, you can create a Pull Request!

You can help translating Loritta to other languages on [Crowdin](https://i18n.perfectdreams.net/loritta-morenitta-cinnamon)! Thanks Crowdin for providing Loritta with a Open Source license! ðŸ˜Š

Approved changes by a proofreader are periodically merged to this repository.

Please do not translate by editing the files on this repository, because the changes will be removed after Crowdin merges the changes! If you prefer working via the YAML files directly, you can edit the YAML files locally and then import the YAML files via Crowdin!
