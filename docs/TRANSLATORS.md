# 🌎 Translating Loritta

Loritta wants to make the world a better place, so she needs to know to speak multiple languages to influence and win over people!

## Fixing typos in the Portuguese language

Portuguese is Loritta's default language, so its steps to fix issues are a bit different compared to translating to other languages.

The Portuguese languages files are [here](../resources/languages/pt).

First, create a fork here on GitHub, then in your fork edit the language files to fix the typos. After you are done, you can create a Pull Request!
