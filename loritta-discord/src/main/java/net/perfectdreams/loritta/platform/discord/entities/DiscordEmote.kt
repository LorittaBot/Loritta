    // and calling "getEmoteById" is costly.
    //
    // So, to avoid issues, we just build our own emote from the code, which should be *hopefully* correct and working.
    // If it ain't correct, then you should fix your "emotes.conf" file! ;)
    //
    // And, to avoid recreating the Discord emote code every single call, we keep it loaded in memory.
